Word Battle Analytic Tool v1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for downloading this program!

INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Word Battle Analytic Tool is a tool to analyse games to provide statistical
information.

SETUP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ensure that you have downloaded Python at 3.7 or 3.8 and PyCharm so that the game
can be properly executed if run from there and for ease of installation of the all
essential modules to run the program. Without these modules the program will crash.

Disclaimer:
The English text file contains offensive language. The program will not censor
or exclude offensive language during the analysis.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Click the "run Word Battle Analytic Tool" bat file to run the program into an command prompt.
Depending on your Python verion, you may click on the py file to run the program directly.

HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Move the desired replay files (.wbr files) into the "Data To Analyse" folder for
the program to analyse.

If this folder is missing, the game will automatically generate a new folder if
any attempt at analysing is made.

The following are the tools which will help produce the data required.

[1] Check files to find board size
[2] Display player statistics
[3] Display letter frequency bar graph
[4] Display word length frequency bar graph
[5] Display square usage heatmap

Option [1] will check the contents of the file to determine the board size, the
number of players, the game mode and game duration. This option will require an
input of the board size. This is so it can highlight all the files that contains
the same board size.

Option [2] will display every player with their name, their wins, loses and draws,
total games played, their win rate, three most frequent words, three most frequent
letters, and average word strength per turn (the word strength is the total of values
that corresponds to their letters. This is used to determine how much word placement
discouragement towards other players per turn).

Option [3] will display a bar graph describing the relationship between the frequency
and the letters it is associated with. Each bar is coloured differently according
to the letter's value.

Option [4] will display a bar graph describing the relationship between the frequency
and the word length it is associated with.

Option [5] will display a heatmap describing the probability of a square being
occupied by a letter.
